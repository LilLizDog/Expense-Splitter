# Expense-Splitter

Expense-Splitter is a web app that helps users manage their shared expenses.

The goal of Sprint 1 was to set up the foundational backend structure for the Expense Splitter web application.
As of the end of Sprint 1, the following things have been completed for Expense-Splitter:
     Initializing FastAPI Project
     Connecting Supabase Integration
     Setting Up Supabase Data Storage
     Making it possible to create an account
     Creating login and signup pages
     Creating welcome page
     Making it possible to add expense entries
     Making it possible to view and manage groups
     Making it possible to check overall balances
     Making code documentation clear and easy to understand


The goal of Sprint 2 was to build upon the foundations from Sprint 1 by connecting Supabase to the frontend and developing core functionality such as login/signup, group creation, and expense management while improving navigation and interface structure.
We aimed to:
Enable data flow between the frontend and Supabase for users, groups, and expenses.
Implement login/signup persistence and build dashboard, account, payments, history, inbox, and friends pages.
Add expense creation and dynamic group management.
Establish consistent navigation and placeholder pages for future features.
Write unit test cases for all new functional components

Goal of Sprint 3:
Deliver a fully functional core version of the Expense Splitter application where users can authenticate, access a real dashboard, manage groups, add expenses with custom splits, and interact with real data across Payments, Friends, History, Settings, and Inbox pages. Complete key CI/CD and testing foundations to ensure stability for Sprint 4’s AI features.
